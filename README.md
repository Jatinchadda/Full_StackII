# Full-Stack Lab — Frontend Experiments

This repository contains a set of small frontend experiments (Vite + React) grouped under `Exp_1`.

## Repository structure

- Exp_1/
  - 1.1/ — Vite React demo
  - 1.2/ — Vite React demo
  - 1.3/ — Vite React demo
  - 1.4/ — Vite React demo

Each subfolder is a self-contained Vite project with its own `package.json`.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ (LTS recommended)
- npm (or yarn)

## Run a demo

Open a terminal and run these commands for the demo you want to run (example uses `1.4`):

```bash
cd Exp_1/1.4
npm install
npm run dev
# then open the dev server URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173)
```

To build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Notes

- Each demo is independent. Use the corresponding folder to develop or inspect its source.
- If you prefer `yarn` or `pnpm`, substitute the package manager commands accordingly.

## License
